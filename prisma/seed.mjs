        content: `# Modern JavaScript: ES2024 Features Every Developer Should Know

JavaScript continues to evolve rapidly. Let's explore the most impactful ES2024 features that will change how you write code.

## 1. Array Grouping

Finally, native array grouping without external libraries:

\`\`\`javascript
const products = [
  { name: 'Laptop', category: 'Electronics', price: 999 },
  { name: 'Chair', category: 'Furniture', price: 299 },
  { name: 'Phone', category: 'Electronics', price: 699 }
];

// Group by category
const grouped = products.group(item => item.category);
console.log(grouped);
// { Electronics: [...], Furniture: [...] }
\`\`\`

## 2. Top-Level Await

No more IIFE wrappers for async operations:

\`\`\`javascript
// Before ES2024
(async () => {
  const data = await fetch('/api/data');
  const json = await data.json();
})();

// ES2024
const data = await fetch('/api/data');
const json = await data.json();
\`\`\`

## 3. Improved Error Handling

New error cause chaining:

\`\`\`javascript
try {
  await fetchUserData(userId);
} catch (originalError) {
  throw new Error('Failed to load user profile', {
    cause: originalError
  });
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

- **Use TypeScript** for better developer experience
- **Implement proper error boundaries** in React apps
- **Leverage modern bundlers** like Vite or Turbopack
- **Write comprehensive tests** with Jest or Vitest

These features make JavaScript more powerful and developer-friendly than ever before.`,

        content: `# Minimalist Living: Finding Joy in Less

In our consumer-driven world, minimalism offers a refreshing alternative—a path to contentment through intentional living.

## What Is Minimalism Really?

Minimalism isn't about living with nothing. It's about living with intention:

- **Quality over quantity** in all aspects of life
- **Mindful consumption** aligned with values
- **Focus on experiences** rather than possessions
- **Mental clarity** through reduced clutter

## The Benefits I've Experienced

After two years of minimalist living, here's what changed:

### Physical Benefits
- Easier to clean and maintain my space
- More time for activities I love
- Reduced financial stress

### Mental Benefits
- **Increased focus** and productivity
- **Reduced decision fatigue** from fewer choices
- **Greater appreciation** for what I own

## Getting Started

### Week 1: The 30-Day Challenge
Remove 30 items from your home. Start small:
- Clothes you haven't worn in a year
- Books you'll never read again  
- Kitchen gadgets you never use

### Week 2-4: Digital Minimalism
- Unsubscribe from unnecessary emails
- Delete apps you don't use
- Organize your digital files

## Practical Tips

1. **Buy nothing new** for 30 days (except essentials)
2. **One in, one out** rule for new purchases
3. **Question every purchase**: "Will this add value to my life?"

> "The things you own end up owning you." - Chuck Palahniuk

Minimalism isn't about deprivation—it's about making room for what truly matters in your life.`,

        content: `# The Complete Guide to Healthy Hair: Science-Based Tips

Beautiful hair isn't just about genetics—science shows us exactly what our hair needs to thrive.

## Understanding Hair Structure

Your hair consists of three layers:

1. **Cuticle** - The protective outer layer
2. **Cortex** - The middle layer containing proteins and pigments  
3. **Medulla** - The innermost layer (absent in fine hair)

## The Science of Hair Growth

Hair grows in three phases:

| Phase | Duration | Characteristics |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Anagen | 2-7 years | Active growth phase |
| Catagen | 2-3 weeks | Transition phase |
| Telogen | 2-3 months | Resting phase |

## Evidence-Based Hair Care Routine

### Daily Care
- **Gentle cleansing** 2-3 times per week maximum
- **Lukewarm water** to prevent cuticle damage
- **Wide-tooth comb** on wet hair only

### Weekly Treatments

\`\`\`markdown
Deep Conditioning Protocol:
1. Apply treatment to mid-lengths and ends
2. Leave for 15-20 minutes
3. Rinse with cool water to seal cuticles
\`\`\`

### Nutritional Support

Key nutrients for hair health:
- **Biotin** (5000 mcg daily)
- **Iron** (especially for women)
- **Protein** (0.8g per kg body weight)
- **Omega-3 fatty acids**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Over-washing** - Strips natural oils  
❌ **Heat styling without protection** - Causes protein damage  
❌ **Tight hairstyles** - Can lead to traction alopecia  
❌ **Chemical overprocessing** - Weakens hair structure  

## Professional Treatments

Consider these science-backed options:
- **Keratin treatments** for damaged hair
- **Scalp massage** to improve circulation
- **Low-level laser therapy** for thinning hair

Remember: Consistency is key. Hair improvements take 2-3 months to become visible due to the growth cycle.`,

Self-improvement doesn't have to be guesswork. By applying data-driven methods, you can optimize your personal growth like a scientist.

## The Quantified Self Movement

Track what matters to see real progress:

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Energy levels** (1-10 scale, 3x daily)
- **Mood** (using apps like Daylio)
- **Sleep quality** (7-9 hours optimal)
- **Physical activity** (steps, workouts, heart rate)
- **Learning progress** (books read, skills practiced)

## Building Systems, Not Goals

Goals are outcomes. Systems are processes:

### Example System Design

\`\`\`javascript
const dailySystem = {
  morning: {
    meditation: '10 minutes',
    exercise: '30 minutes',
    planning: '15 minutes'
  },
  work: {
    deepWork: '4 hours (pomodoro)',
    breaks: 'every 90 minutes',
    learning: '1 hour new skill'
  },
  evening: {
    reflection: '10 minutes journaling',
    reading: '30 minutes',
    preparation: 'next day setup'
  }
};
\`\`\`

## The Science of Habit Formation

Research shows habits form through:

1. **Cue** - Environmental trigger
2. **Routine** - The behavior itself  
3. **Reward** - Positive reinforcement

### Habit Stacking Formula

> After I [existing habit], I will [new habit]

**Examples:**
- After I pour my coffee, I will write three priorities
- After I sit at my desk, I will do 10 push-ups
- After I brush my teeth, I will read one page

## Measuring Progress

### Weekly Reviews
Track these metrics:
- Habit consistency (%)
- Energy levels (average)
- Key accomplishments
- Lessons learned
- Next week's focus

### Monthly Assessments
- Review quarterly goals
- Adjust systems based on data
- Celebrate wins (no matter how small)

## Tools for Success

**Tracking Apps:**
- Habitica (gamification)
- Streaks (simple habit tracking)  
- Notion (comprehensive life OS)

**Wearables:**
- Oura Ring (sleep & recovery)
- Apple Watch (activity & heart rate)
- Whoop (strain & recovery)

## Key Insights

> "You are what you repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle

The magic isn't in perfection—it's in consistent, small improvements compounded over time. Start with one system, track the data, and optimize based on results.

Time is your most valuable resource. Here's how to make every minute count using proven frameworks from productivity experts.

## The Time Management Hierarchy

### Level 1: Time Tracking
You can't manage what you don't measure:

\`\`\`markdown
Week 1 Challenge:
- Track every activity for 7 days
- Use RescueTime or Toggl
- Identify your "time wasters"
- Calculate your "deep work" hours
\`\`\`

### Level 2: Prioritization Frameworks

#### The Eisenhower Matrix

| Urgent | Not Urgent |
|--------|------------|
| **Important**: Do First | **Important**: Schedule |
| **Not Important**: Delegate | **Not Important**: Eliminate |

#### The ABCDE Method
- **A**: Must do (serious consequences)
- **B**: Should do (mild consequences)  
- **C**: Nice to do (no consequences)
- **D**: Delegate
- **E**: Eliminate

### Level 3: Advanced Techniques

## Time Blocking Mastery

### The Perfect Day Template

\`\`\`
6:00-7:00   Morning Routine (non-negotiable)
7:00-9:00   Deep Work Block #1
9:00-9:30   Email & Communications
9:30-12:00  Deep Work Block #2
12:00-1:00  Lunch & Walk
1:00-3:00   Meetings & Collaboration
3:00-4:00   Administrative Tasks
4:00-5:00   Learning & Development
5:00+       Personal Time
\`\`\`

## The Psychology of Productivity

### Flow State Triggers
- **Clear goals** with immediate feedback
- **Challenge-skill balance** (sweet spot)
- **Elimination of distractions**
- **Single-tasking focus**

### Energy Management

Map your energy to your tasks:

**High Energy (9-11 AM):** Creative work, problem-solving  
**Medium Energy (1-3 PM):** Meetings, collaboration  
**Low Energy (3-5 PM):** Admin, email, planning  

## Digital Tools & Systems

### The Tech Stack

**Calendar:** Google Calendar + Calendly  
**Tasks:** Todoist or Things 3  
**Notes:** Obsidian or Notion  
**Focus:** Freedom or Cold Turkey  

### Automation Ideas

\`\`\`javascript
// Example: Automated daily planning
const automations = [
  'Email filters and labels',
  'Calendar event templates', 
  'Recurring task creation',
  'Meeting preparation checklists',
  'Weekly review reminders'
];
\`\`\`

## Common Time Traps

❌ **Perfectionism** - 80/20 rule applies  
❌ **Over-scheduling** - Leave 25% buffer time  
❌ **Notification addiction** - Batch process communications  
❌ **Meeting overload** - Default to 25-minute meetings  

## Advanced Strategies

### Time Boxing
Assign fixed time periods to tasks:
- Email: 30 minutes at 9 AM and 4 PM
- Social media: 15 minutes after lunch
- Planning: Sunday 6-7 PM

### The Two-Minute Rule
If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now.

### Weekly Planning Ritual
Every Sunday:
1. Review previous week's wins/losses
2. Plan upcoming week's priorities  
3. Schedule important but not urgent tasks
4. Prepare for Monday morning

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics monthly:
- **Planned vs. actual** time allocation
- **Deep work hours** per week
- **Goal completion** rate
- **Stress levels** (1-10 scale)

> "Time management is really life management." - Robin Sharma

Remember: Perfect systems don't exist. Find what works for your lifestyle and adjust based on results. The goal isn't to fill every minute—it's to ensure your time aligns with your priorities.`,

        content: `# The Psychology of Habit Formation: Why We Do What We Do

Understanding the science behind habits is the first step to mastering them. Let's explore what happens in your brain when habits form.

## The Neuroscience of Habits

### The Habit Loop Circuit

Your brain processes habits in the **basal ganglia**, while conscious decisions happen in the **prefrontal cortex**:

1. **Cue Detection** - Environmental trigger activates pattern recognition
2. **Routine Execution** - Behavior runs on "autopilot"
3. **Reward Prediction** - Brain anticipates the dopamine hit

\`\`\`markdown
Brain Chemistry Changes:
- Week 1-2: High prefrontal cortex activity (effort required)
- Week 3-4: Activity shifts to basal ganglia
- Week 8+: Habit becomes automatic (neuroplasticity complete)
\`\`\`

## The Habit Formation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initiation (Days 1-7)
- **High cognitive load** - Requires conscious effort
- **Inconsistent performance** - Success rate ~40%
- **Strong willpower dependence** - Mental fatigue affects compliance

### Phase 2: Learning (Days 8-30) 
- **Pattern recognition** improves
- **Cue sensitivity** increases
- **Success rate** climbs to ~65%

### Phase 3: Stability (Days 31-66)
- **Automatic execution** begins
- **Reduced cognitive effort** required
- **Success rate** reaches ~80%

## Advanced Habit Design

### The 4 Laws of Behavior Change

| Law | Good Habits | Bad Habits |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| **1st Law** | Make it Obvious | Make it Invisible |
| **2nd Law** | Make it Attractive | Make it Unattractive |  
| **3rd Law** | Make it Easy | Make it Difficult |
| **4th Law** | Make it Satisfying | Make it Unsatisfying |

### Habit Stacking 2.0

Advanced stacking formulas:

\`\`\`javascript
// Micro-habit chains
const habitChain = {
  trigger: "Put feet on floor (wake up)",
  chain: [
    "Drink glass of water (1 minute)",
    "Write 3 priorities (2 minutes)", 
    "Do 10 squats (1 minute)",
    "Read 1 page (3 minutes)"
  ],
  totalTime: "7 minutes",
  compoundingEffect: "Massive over time"
};
\`\`\`

## The Role of Identity

### Identity-Based Habits

Instead of focusing on outcomes, focus on identity:

❌ **Outcome-based:** "I want to read 12 books this year"  
✅ **Identity-based:** "I am someone who reads daily"

### Identity Shift Process

1. **Decide who you want to be**
2. **Prove it with small wins** 3. **Let success change your self-image**
4. **Repeat until it's automatic**

## Environmental Design

### The Power of Context

Your environment shapes your behavior more than willpower:

**Kitchen Design for Health:**
- Keep fruits visible on counter
- Store junk food in opaque containers
- Use smaller plates for portion control

**Workspace Design for Focus:**
- Remove phone from desk
- Keep single notebook for priorities
- Use blue light for alertness

## Habit Troubleshooting

### Common Failure Points

**Week 1:** Overambitious goals  
**Solution:** Start with 2-minute version

**Week 3:** Life disruption breaks chain  
**Solution:** Never miss twice in a row

**Week 6:** Plateau effect  
**Solution:** Add tiny progressive challenges

### Recovery Strategies

\`\`\`markdown
The Comeback Protocol:
1. Acknowledge the slip without judgment
2. Identify the specific trigger that caused failure  
3. Design a prevention strategy for next time
4. Restart immediately (don't wait for Monday)
5. Lower the barrier to make success inevitable
\`\`\`

## Measuring Habit Strength

### The Habit Strength Formula

**Frequency × Context Stability × Emotional Reward = Habit Strength**

Track weekly:
- Completion rate (%)
- Consistency score
- Ease rating (1-10)
- Satisfaction level (1-10)

## Advanced Applications

### Habit Cycling
Rotate seasonal habits to prevent boredom:
- **Winter:** Indoor workouts, reading, skill-building
- **Spring:** Outdoor activities, social connections
- **Summer:** Adventure, travel, new experiences  
- **Fall:** Reflection, planning, preparation

The key insight? Your brain is literally rewiring itself every time you repeat a behavior. Make sure you're building the circuits you want.

Understanding the psychology behind habits gives you the power to design your life intentionally. Start small, be consistent, and trust the process.`,

        content: `# Building Scalable APIs: Node.js Best Practices for 2024

Modern applications demand APIs that can handle millions of requests while maintaining performance, security, and reliability.

## Architecture Patterns

### Clean Architecture for APIs

\`\`\`javascript
// Project structure
src/
├── controllers/     // Handle HTTP requests
├── services/        // Business logic
├── repositories/    // Data access layer
├── models/         // Data structures
├── middleware/     // Cross-cutting concerns
└── utils/          // Helper functions
\`\`\`

### Example Implementation

\`\`\`javascript
// controllers/userController.js
class UserController {
  constructor(userService) {
    this.userService = userService;
  }
  
  async createUser(req, res, next) {
    try {
      const userData = req.body;
      const user = await this.userService.createUser(userData);
      
      res.status(201).json({
        success: true,
        data: user,
        message: 'User created successfully'
      });
    } catch (error) {
      next(error);
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Database Query Optimization

\`\`\`javascript
// Bad: N+1 Query Problem
const users = await User.findAll();
for (const user of users) {
  user.posts = await Post.findByUserId(user.id);
}

// Good: Use includes/joins
const users = await User.findAll({
  include: [{
    model: Post,
    as: 'posts'
  }]
});
\`\`\`

### 2. Caching Strategies

\`\`\`javascript
// Redis caching middleware
const cache = (duration = 300) => {
  return async (req, res, next) => {
    const key = req.originalUrl;
    const cached = await redis.get(key);
    
    if (cached) {
      return res.json(JSON.parse(cached));
    }
    
    // Override res.json to cache response
    const originalJson = res.json;
    res.json = function(data) {
      redis.setex(key, duration, JSON.stringify(data));
      originalJson.call(this, data);
    };
    
    next();
  };
};
\`\`\`

### 3. Rate Limiting

\`\`\`javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP',
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});

app.use('/api/', limiter);
\`\`\`

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation & Sanitization

\`\`\`javascript
const Joi = require('joi');

const userSchema = Joi.object({
  email: Joi.string().email().required(),
  password: Joi.string().min(8).pattern(
    /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])/
  ).required(),
  age: Joi.number().integer().min(13).max(120)
});

const validateUser = (req, res, next) => {
  const { error } = userSchema.validate(req.body);
  if (error) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      success: false,
      message: error.details[0].message
    });
  }
  next();
};
\`\`\`

### Security Headers & CORS

\`\`\`javascript
const helmet = require('helmet');
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));

app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200
}));
\`\`\`

## Error Handling & Logging

### Centralized Error Handler

\`\`\`javascript
class AppError extends Error {
  constructor(message, statusCode) {
    super(message);
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.isOperational = true;
    
    Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
  }
}

const globalErrorHandler = (err, req, res, next) => {
  const statusCode = err.statusCode || 500;
  const message = err.isOperational ? err.message : 'Something went very wrong!';

  res.status(statusCode).json({
    status: 'error',
    message,
    // Add stack trace in development only
    stack: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? err.stack : undefined
  });
};

app.use(globalErrorHandler);
\`\`\`
`, // CLOSES the 'content' field for the last object
    }, // CLOSES the last object in the array
]; // CLOSES the entire blogPosts array

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ //

async function seedBlogPosts() {
    try {
        console.log("🌱 Starting blog posts seeding...");

        // Clear existing blog posts (optional - remove if you want to keep existing data)
        await prisma.blogPost.deleteMany();
        console.log("🗑️  Cleared existing blog posts");

        // Insert new blog posts
        for (const post of blogPosts) {
            await prisma.blogPost.create({
                data: post,
            });
            console.log(`✅ Created blog post: "${post.title}"`);
        }

        console.log(`🎉 Successfully seeded ${blogPosts.length} blog posts!`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("❌ Error seeding blog posts:", error);
        throw error;
    } finally {
        await prisma.$disconnect();
    }
}

// Execute the seed function
seedBlogPosts().catch((error) => {
    console.error("Failed to seed database:", error);
    process.exit(1);
});
